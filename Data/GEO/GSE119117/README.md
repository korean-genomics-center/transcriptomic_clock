mRNA-Seq of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from individuals before, during, and after acute HCV infection. Acute HCV infection resulted in spotaneous viral resolution (n=6) or chronic infection (n=8). Four time points were examined per subject: 
i) Pre-infection baseline (Variable); 
ii) Early acute (2-9 weeks, mean 6 weeks); 
iii) Late acute (15 – 20 weeks, mean 17 weeks); and 
iv) Follow up (25 – 71 weeks, mean 52 weeks)
